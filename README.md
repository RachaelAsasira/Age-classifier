# Age-classifier
This repository contains a Python program that classifies a user's age into various categories and outputs corresponding messages based on the entered age. 
The program incorporates specific conditions to generate appropriate responses:

If the user is 40 or over, it outputs "You're over the hill."
If the user is 65 or older, it outputs "Enjoy your retirement!"
If the user is under 13, it outputs "You qualify for the kiddie discount."
If the user is 21, it outputs "Congrats on your 21st!"
For any other age, it outputs "Age is but a number."

This program is designed to be intuitive and informative, providing personalized messages based on the user's age input. It serves as a simple yet interactive tool for age classification, suitable for various applications.

Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome. Feel free to use and modify this program to suit your needs!
